## AWSCerts class

Provides methods to manage SSL certificates

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class AWSCerts 
```

## Remarks

Certificates in ACM are regional resources. To use a certificate with Elastic Load Balancing for the same domain in more than one AWS region, you must request or import a certificate for each region. For certificates provided by ACM, this means you must revalidate each domain name in the certificate for each region. You cannot copy a certificate between regions.

For AWS CloudFront, you must request or import the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region.
